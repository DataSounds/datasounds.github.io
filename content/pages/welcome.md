# Welcome to DataSounds.org

This project intends to propose a sonification method for 
scientific visualization of time series analysis and other 
sources of results generally obtained graphically.

We were motivated through ocean color analysis concerning 
the visualization of color intensities meaning concentrations 
data of parameters. 
All of this is made with single 2D plots, so why not sounds?

We are improving our methods to be more useful in multivariate 
analysis and in other fields of remote sensing as well on spatial 
oceanography process.

DataSounds offers for the scientist a possibility to interpret his 
dataset with a sonification method, where colors, numbers and shapes 
can be music too.

If you want to taste our Demo, based on Chlorophyll-a time series 
from satellite MODIS, access: [ocean.DataSounds.org](http://ocean.datasounds.org)

Have a nice Scientific *Sound display*!
